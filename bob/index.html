    <h1>MEET BOB</h1>
    <p>He is husband to Linda and father to Tina, Gene, and Louise. He is a third generation restaurateur and is 47 years old. Bob was born to an unnamed mother and Big Bob who ran a diner called "Big Bob's Diner." Despite his somewhat pessimistic personality he loves and cares for his family very much as well as his restaurant.</p>
    <h1>MEET LINDA</h1>
    <p>Wife to Bob and mother to Tina, Gene, and Louise. She is fun-loving and happy go lucky, a positive contrast to her husband's pessimism. Linda is generally laid back and obliviously enthusiastic in whatever she does. Linda is shown to be very supportive, such as encouraging Tina
    to write erotic fanfiction or supporting her sister Gayle in her anus-themed paintings which Gayle hangs in the restaurant.</p>
    <h1>MEET TINA</h1>
    <p>Oldest of the three Belcher children and is socially awkward and insecure, and tends to freeze up when faced with any sort of decision. She is like many teenage girls, fantasizing over her crushes and a fan of boy bands such as "Boyz 4 Now". She likes horses, rainbows, butts, zombies, writing erotic fiction, and movies.</p>
    <h1>MEET GENE</h1>
    <p>The second child and the only boy of the family. Like his mother, Gene is carefree and friendly. Gene enjoys pestering everyone around him by using sound effects with either his Casio SK-5 keyboard or his megaphone. He frequently records fart sounds and uses them as sound effects and add tions to his music.</p>
    <h1>MEET LOUISE</h1>
    <p>The youngest Belcher, a schemer with a mischievous and cynical personality. Though her intentions in the series consistently appear to be dubious, her schemes are often intended to right injustices antiheroically, though ultimately her plans are frequently narcissistic in nature. Louise is protective and has a deep affection for her family, though she displays her feelings towards each in different fashions.</p>
